# finalproject
So i had a extreme amount of difficulty with this project and found it was way above my skill level. I thought making breakout would be easier because i thought it would be pretty similar to pong, but it wasn't. I had so much difficulty figuring out the tables and for loops for lua, which eventually when I found out to use them, it broke every other part of the project. It wouldn't allow for my velocity to work for whatever reason. I'm proud of what I could do especially considering lua is a lot different than python in some ways, but overall i was pretty disappointed with how this turned out. Once i figured out how tables worked i found generating the bricks to be easy. Because I just needed to put how many rows and bircks per row i wanted. I found coloring them to be fun, and it made sense as well. In the beginning i had an issue with the virtual width and height messing up positions but I troubleshooted some numbers and it turned out. Overall I could do a good amount, I just couldn't figure out the collusion for bricks for the live of me. I did understand how to get it so the bricks disappeared by just setting row and col back to 0, but it didn't matter if the collusion didn't work.
