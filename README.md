# finalproject
So i had a extreme amount of difficulty with this project and found it was way above my skill level. I thought making breakout would be easier because i thought it would be pretty similar to pong, but it wasn't. I had so much difficulty figuring out the tables and for loops for lua, which eventually when I found out to use them, it broke every other part of the project. It wouldn't allow for my velocity to work for whatever reason. I'm proud of what I could do especially considering lua is a lot different than python in some ways, but overall i was pretty disappointed with how this turned out.
